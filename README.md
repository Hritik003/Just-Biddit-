# Just-biddit - an Online Auction Website

## Java Web Project

This project is about an online auction website, that gives the ability to the users to sell or buy different items through the method of bidding. Having at their disposal the right tools to filter their searches, they can find exactly what they are looking for and place their bid. Also, they can place for bidding whatever they want by uploading in the information or/and some photos. Finally, at the end of an auction, the involved users can communicate through the messaging service.
